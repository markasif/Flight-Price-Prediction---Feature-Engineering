# Flight-Price-Prediction---Feature-Engineering
 Feature engineering for flight price prediction involved extracting temporal features (e.g., day, month, year), creating separate columns for arrival and departure times, and one-hot encoding categorical variables like airline and destination. Missing values were handled, and features were normalized for better model performance.
